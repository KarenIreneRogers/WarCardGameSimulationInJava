This project satisfied an assignment for a Java programming boot camp.  

A deck of cards is created, shuffled and dealt to two players.  The cards are displayed one at a time, 
compared with the card of the opponent, and points are awarded (except in the case of a tie).  Score is
kept, and a winner is declared at the end of the round.

While the display is limited to the console, I tried to make it as clear and appealing as possible.  Each 
player has a different color, and the color coding is used throughout to show which player is ahead
as play progresses.  There is no pause for readability, mostly because that makes it too slow for 
trouble shooting.  The viewer can scroll through the results at their leisure, rather than having to wait 
for a certain time (or press a key) before play proceeds.

This was a fun little project.  I hope you enjoy it!
